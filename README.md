This is a simple educational project demonstrating authentication integration between an ASP.NET MVC application and Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution.

Key Features:
   - User authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
   - Secure login and logout flows managed by Keycloak.
   - Role-based access control to restrict functionalities based on user permissions.
   - Token validation and API protection for secure communication.

Technology Stack:
   - Backend: ASP.NET MVC (C#), ADO.NET
   - Authentication Server: Keycloak
   - Database: SQL Server
   - Other: Identity and Access Management (IAM) concepts

This project was built as a learning exercise to explore how external authentication providers can be integrated into ASP.NET applications. It serves as a foundation for implementing more advanced authentication and security mechanisms in future projects.
